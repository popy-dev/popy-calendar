Year 10k and RFC 2550
=====================

You've heard of the year 2000 bug, the year 2038 bug. Did you ever wonder what will happen in year 1000 ?

```php
<?php

var_dump(DateTime::createFromFormat('Y-m-d', '10000-01-01'));

?>
```

Output : 
```
bool(false)
```

Hopefully, some people have already anticipated the issue, and worked on the [RFC 2550](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2550),
which intend to solve date storing and sorting, supporting years past the universe lifetime if needed, and compatible
with current 4 years digits dates.

How to use the RFC 2550 number converter
----------------------------------------

The RFC 2550 implementation comes in form of a ```Popy\Calendar\Formatter\NumberConverterInterface``` and a
```Popy\Calendar\Parser\SymbolParserInterface```.

```NumberConverterInterface``` are (usually) used by formatters to render the 'y' format symbol, so the easiest way to use it is simply to plug this
converter in place of the traditional 2-digits converter.

```SymbolParserInterface``` are used to match a parsed string part to a symbol (and extract its value), which is mandatory as RFC2550 dates won't
match the pattern used to find regular 'y' symbol.

Plug both the ```NumberConverterInterface``` and the ```SymbolParserInterface``` at the right places, and voil√†, you can now format dates according to the
Y10k ready RFC 2550 format.

Obviously, the ```ConfigurableFactory``` is here to help :


```php
<?php

require './vendor/autoload.php';

use Popy\Calendar\Factory\ConfigurableFactory;

$factory = new ConfigurableFactory();

$calendar = $factory->build([
    'number' => 'rfc2550',
    'additional_symbol_parser' => 'rfc2550',
]);

// Parsing a "normal" y40k date
$date = $calendar->parse('40000', 'y');
echo $date->format('Y') . "\n";

// Now formatting it property :
echo $calendar->format($date, 'y-m-d') . chr(10);

// Parsing a RFC2550 date :
$date = $calendar->parse('A10000', 'y');
echo $date->format('Y') . "\n";
?>
```

Output : 
```
40000
A40000-01-01
10000
```
